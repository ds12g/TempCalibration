# TempCalibration
Generates a calibration equation for Temperature as a function of resistance.

This was my first attempt at creating a full GUI with Java. The purpose of this is to create a calibration equation for a measurement I was performing in the lab. I did not have a decent thermometer to use, so I used a plain resistor and approximated it to have a linear temperature relationship. The results from the calibration were more for a qualitative idea about the samples that I was measuring. 

It is quite simple: it takes four numeric arguments and generates an equation for a line with the option of the Temperature scale being kelvin or celsius.
